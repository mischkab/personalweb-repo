        My name is Mischka Booley and I am a Software Engineering Student with Academy Xi. I have recently completed my HTML and CSS labs and can say I am confident in both. I work fulltime for a software company so I am familiar with the development process and cycles and I enjoy spending my time fixing bugs. I look forward to hearing from you and I am exciting to take on new projects.
